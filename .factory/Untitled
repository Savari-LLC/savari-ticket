So, I want to build a ticket system where we use Better Off and Convex and the Convex Droid Agent. The ticket system will have three types of users: an operator, a driver, and a business. The way it works is that the operator adds routes (the basic details of a route, like the name). The business adds passengers (the name and email). Once we add a passenger, it will generate a QR code that we can download from the system. The driver can log in, click on a route, and then basically have an option to scan the passengers. With the driver can scan each passenger, so we know who went on each route, how many people went on each route, and all that stuff for reporting. All the timings are done and everything is well please create a detailed spec on how to do this with the design all done with Chat CN, clearly explaining why you know, all following best practices. It would be good to have this with multi-operator, so we have multi-tenant architecture. If we can create something that way as well, that'd be even better. Basically, we have everything as an operator ID, probably because the operator is the ones who could be running the system. Yeah, that's it. I haven't been permission set, so yeah
